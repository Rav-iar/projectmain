      To help the homeless overcome addiction, starting with stable housing is the first step. Permanent supportive housing integrates affordable housing with voluntary services to bring up the needs of chronically homeless people. The concept is intended to build independent living connecting people within the community with treatment and job services.

        <h2>Reasons</h2>
        <p>
          According to this article, both homelessness and crime have a big connection. If we do something to decrease the homelessness population, the crime rate will go down as well. Because homeless people get desperate for money, food, and shelter, they tend to commit crimes to achieve it. The lower the crime rate the more visitors and money the state will receive.
The biggest driving factor when a family decides their new home is crime rates, people prefer low crime neighborhoods than high. For example California has the highest homeless populations, so a high number of people are moving out of it. In conclusion this plan will insure that Texas will stay safe and most likely bring in lots of money in return.
